“Yoga is the perfect opportunity to be curious about who you are.”
### INTRODUCTION
Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. Yoga is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophical traditions. The origins of yoga have been speculated to date back to pre-Vedic Indian traditions; it is mentioned in the Rigveda, but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, in ancient India's ascetic and śramaṇa movements. On December 1, 2016, yoga was listed by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage.
